# Heart_Disease-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Heart Disease dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes clinical data to identify key factors influencing heart disease. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the dataset was examined through exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover relationships between variables like age, gender, cholesterol, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate.

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand which factors contribute most to heart disease.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and correlations.
- Visualize insights for better interpretation by doctors or researchers.
- Lay the groundwork for future predictive modeling.
- 
## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset Details
- Dataset file: `Heart_disease.csv`
- Rows × Columns: 920 × 16
- Key Features: age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, max heart rate, resting blood pressure, ST depression, exercise induced angina, slope of ST segment, number of vessels, thalassemia, and target variable `num`.
- Target variable: `num` (0 = no disease, 1–4 = presence of disease). Converted into binary for analysis (`target`).

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Heart disease is more prevalent among males aged 40–60.
- Higher cholesterol and specific chest pain types (cp=2,3) increase disease risk.
- Higher maximum heart rate (thalach) usually indicates a healthier heart.
- Correlation heatmap highlights the most influential features for disease prediction.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Extend analysis using machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost to predict heart disease risk.
- Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Power BI.
- Combine with larger datasets for more generalized predictive analytics.
- Use in real-world healthcare applications to assist early diagnosis and preventive measures.
